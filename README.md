glymur: a Python interface for JPEG 2000
=========================================

**glymur** contains a Python interface to the OpenJPEG library
which allows linux and mac users to read and write JPEG 2000 files.  
**glymur** works on Python 2.7 and 3.3.  Python 3.3 is strongly recommended.

Until I figure out how to get readthedocs.org to handle numpydoc, you'll have
to do as follows to build the documentation first::
    
    $ make -C docs html
    $ open docs/build/html/index.html
