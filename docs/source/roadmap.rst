Roadmap
-------

Here's an incomplete list of what I'd like to focus on in the near future.

    * continue to monitor upstream changes in the openjp2 library
    * investigate using CFFI or cython instead of ctypes to wrap openjp2
    * investigate swapping out ElementTree for LXML
    * eventually expose the openjp2 API
    * investigate JPIP
