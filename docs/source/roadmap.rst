Roadmap
-------

Here's an incomplete list of what I'd like to focus on in the future.

    * continue to monitor upstream changes in the openjp2 library
    * investigate using CFFI or cython instead of ctypes to wrap openjp2
    * investigate adding write support for UUID/XMP boxes (potentially a big project)
    * investigate JPIP (likely to be an even bigger project)
