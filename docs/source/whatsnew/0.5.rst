=====================
Changes in glymur 0.5
=====================

Changes in 0.5.12
=================

Bug Fixes
---------

* Minor documentation fixes for grammar and style.


Changes in 0.5.11
=================

Changes unlikely to affect compatibility
----------------------------------------

* Added support for Python 3.4.
* OpenJPEG 1.5.2 and 2.0.1 are officially supported.

Changes which may break existing code
-------------------------------------

* OpenJPEG 2.1.0 is officially supported, but the ABI changes introduced by
  OpenJPEG 2.1.0 required corresponding changes to glymur's ctypes interface.
  The ``glymur.lib.openjp2.stream_create_default_file_stream_v3`` and
  ``glymur.lib.openjp2.opj.stream_destroy_v3`` functions were renamed to follow
  OpenJPEG's upstream changes.  Unless you were using the development version
  of OpenJPEG, you should not be affected by this.

=================

Bug fixes
---------

* Fixed bad warning issued when an unsupported reader requirement box mask
  length was encountered.


Changes in 0.5.9
================

Bug fixes
